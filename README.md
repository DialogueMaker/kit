# Dialogue Maker Kit
The Dialogue Maker Kit is intended for developers who use Roblox Studio over external tools and package managers. It includes a collection of common Dialogue Maker packages, and includes a few folders for you to organize your Dialogue Maker themes, examples, and other common packages.

## Installation
### Get it from the Roblox Creator Store
You can get the Dialogue Maker Kit from the [Roblox Creator Store](). This model is automatically updated by GitHub Actions, so anything you see in the production branch will be in the model.

### Place the Dialogue Maker in ReplicatedStorage or somewhere else
You can put the Dialogue Maker Kit anywhere in your project, but a common place is ReplicatedStorage. Dialogue Maker Group doesn't recommend putting it in StarterPlayerScripts because it will create a copy of the kit for each player.

### Celebrate
Because you're all done. 

## Updating
You can use the [Dialogue Maker plugin](https://github.com/DialogueMaker/plugin) to update the Packages folder when you need to. You can also add the latest copy of the kit to your game using Roblox Studio's Toolbox.

## Examples
See the [Examples](./src/Examples) folder for some examples on how to use the kit.
